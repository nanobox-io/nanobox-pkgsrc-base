Extends nose.plugins.cover to add Cobertura-style XML reports

nose-xmlcover

A companion to the built-in nose.plugins.cover, this plugin will write out an XML coverage report to a file named coverage.xml.

It will honor all the options you pass to the Nose coverage plugin, especially –cover-package.
